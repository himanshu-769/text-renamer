Hello Everyone! With this script, you can rename as many files as you want, whether it's 5,000 or 10,000.

If you want to replace a specific text in file names, you can use the specific.py script.
If you want to add your name at the end of file names, you can use the after.py script.
No matter how many files you have, this script will rename them efficiently. I hope you enjoy using it! ðŸ˜Š
